Implementation of the SatVision-TOA model for All-Sky Remote Sensing Imagery.

_The package includes the pretrained SatVision-TOA model along with fine-tuned versions for both 1) Image Reconstruction and 2) 3D Cloud Retrieval._
_While instructions for training the model are provided for reference, this deployment is primarily intended for downstream SatVision-TOA task usage and customization._

Concept and design details are provided in the paper on [arXiv.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17000)

## What is SatVision-TOA?

We introduce SatVision-TOA, a novel foundation model pre-trained on 14-band MODIS L1B Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) radiance imageries, addressing the need for models that handle moderate- and coarse-resolution all- sky remote sensing data. The SatVision-TOA model is pre-trained using a Masked-Image-Modeling (MIM) framework and the SwinV2 architecture, and learns detailed contextual representations through self-supervised learning without the need for labels. It is a 3 billion parameter model that is trained on 100 million images.  To validate the model we focused on two key applications: 
1. Image reconstruction performance, which evaluates the masked-image-modeling task on unseen data.
2. 3D cloud retrieval, a downstream task targeting the prediction of vertical cloud structure.

## Why use SatVision-TOA?

This is the largest foundation model trained solely on satellite remote sensing imagery. Initial results indicate that SatVision-TOA achieves superior performance over baseline methods when applied to downstream tasks such as 3D cloud retrieval.  Our work advances pre-trained vision modeling for multispectral remote sensing by learning from a variety of atmospheric and aerosol conditions to improve cloud and land surface monitoring.

_SatVision-TOA is a _foundation model_, which means that it was first generally trained on a lot of data,_
_and then can be adapted to specialized cloud and land surface monitoring tasks with relatively little data._
