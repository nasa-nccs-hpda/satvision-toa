## USER GUIDE 

SatVision-TOA is composed of packaged Python applications called pipelines, which weave together 
configurable modules to perform workflows.  The runtime instructions for these pipelines below, 
typically involve running a python command-line application with a single configuration file.  
We anticipate that users will only initiate pipelines that leverage our _published, pre-trained_ model.  
For example, (1) image reconstruction and (2) 3D cloud retrieval.  

_For completeness, we have also provided the training pipeline (3) that was used to pre-train_ 
_the SatVision-TOA model.  Note that this pipeline requires advanced GPU and storage requirements._

**_NOTE: The Getting Started section must be completed [first.](requirements/README.md)_**

## <b> Running SatVision-TOA Pipelines </b>

### <b> Command-Line Interface (CLI) </b>

To run tasks with **SatVision-TOA**, use the following command:

```bash
$ python pytorch-caney/pytorch_caney/ptc_cli.py --config-path <Path to config file>
```
